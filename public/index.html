      <h2>About</h2>
    <p>After hearing of several school shootings across our country, our team felt compelled to take a stand against gun violence in schools. While being high school students, we understand the fear of school shootings and how anxiety-provoking such events can be. We want to show that gun violence is not a controversial issue but rather a public health issue that we must address.</p>
    <p>Student leaders power SFSL, a nationwide organization with local chapters. An SFSL Chapter can be started at any high school by any student!</p>

      <div class="bottom-side-gun-violence-blurb">
        <p>Gun violence refers to any violent act that involves the use of firearms. This can include criminal activity, such as homicides and armed robberies, as well as unintentional shootings and suicides. Gun violence has become a significant public health and safety issue in many countries, particularly in the United States, where it is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths and injuries each year.</p>
